# E-commerce Sales Analysis using SQL and Tableau
## Introduction
This repository contains the SQL scripts and documentation for my first end-to-end data analytics project. The goal of this project was to analyze a Brazilian e-commerce dataset to identify key trends in sales, products, and customer behavior. The final insights were visualized in an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Business Questions
I aimed to answer the following key business questions:
1. What are the monthly sales trends and are there any seasonal peaks?
2. Top product categories by revenue?
3. Which are the top 10 best-selling products?
4. Which states generate the most revenue?
5. What are the most popular product categories within each state?
